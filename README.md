# 🔐 Py Auth System

A step-by-step evolving project that begins as a simple CLI-based login/register app using Python dictionaries and gradually transforms into a secure, GUI-based user authentication system using file storage and password hashing.

## 🚀 Project Phases & Features

### ⏳ Phase 1: CLI (In-Memory Dictionary)
- [ ] Register new users
- [ ] Login existing users
- [ ] View user profile
- [ ] Change/reset Password
- [ ] Basic CLI interface

### ⏳ Phase 2: File-Based Storage
- [ ] Save user data in JSON file
- [ ] Load data at startup
- [ ] Prevent duplicate registrations

### ⏳ Phase 3: Password Hashing
- [ ] Secure password storage using `hashlib`
- [ ] Password verification during login

### ⏳ Phase 4: Input Validation
- [ ] Validate email format
- [ ] Enforce password strength
- [ ] Meaningful error messages

### ⏳ Phase 5: GUI with Tkinter
- [ ] Register/Login forms with Tkinter
- [ ] Message boxes for success/failure
- [ ] Password masking

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- `hashlib` (for password hashing)
- JSON (for user data persistence)
